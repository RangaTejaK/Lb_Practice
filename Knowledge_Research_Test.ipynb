    "\n",
    "These are palindromes which are graphically reversible. Not all letters in mirrored ones necessarily have symmetry about a vertical axis (A, H, I, M, O, T, U, V, W, X) since some letters are (more or less) mirror images of others (e.g. L and J). Therefore a mirrored one is not necessarily also a traditional palindrome. Punctuation and spaces cannot be ignored when creating this type. When reversed A TOYOTA becomes ATOYOT A which, strictly speaking, is not the same. WOT TOW, although fairly meaningless, is a valid mirrored one. Of course, with this type of palindrome, it is important whether upper or lower case letters are used: bid is a mirrored one, but BID is not."
